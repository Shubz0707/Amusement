				<h2>WORLD OF ADVENTURES</h2>
					<p>
					
	Geauga Lake was a theme park in Bainbridge Township and Aurora, Ohio, United States. Established in 1887 in what had been a local recreation area adjacent to a lake of the same name, the first amusement ride was added in 1889, and the park's first roller coaster – later known as the Big Dipper – was built in 1925. In 1969, the park was sold to Funtime, Inc., and was expanded over the years with additional rides and amenities.			</p>
